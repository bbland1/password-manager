The user will type in the website they want to save the information of, change the default email (or leave it), enter or generate a password and hit add. 

The password field automatically shows * as the characters but can be toggled to show the characters by clicking the checkbox next to it. When the user clicks the generate password button to create a new password the password will be automatically added to their clipboard ready to be pasted in the password field for where they want to use it. 

After they have added passwords, the user can type in an website and click search to look up previously stored information. If the user has stored more than one email for the specified site a pop up box will show up listing the emails saved for the sites and allow the user to select which one they want. After the user has selected which one they want or if a site only has one to display a new pop up message will show up to allow the user to see the password and email they are searching for and the password should be automatically added to their clipboard ready to be pasted.


To use the program the repo can be forked and then ran with `python main.py`

What was used: Python with tkinter

**Possible future things:** I'd like to add encryption that uses a password to access the program so that it can be better protected and the info is encrypted in the files if anyone gets in.

**Personal Highlights:**
Even when I was stuck one things, I was giddy each time a new thing worked. I was showing my husband and telling my dogs (embarrassing but true). I also was really in the groove of doing this myself. Yes I was still googling and looking up things but it was when I was getting to points I had never done before that I was determined to add or when I didn't get the error that I didn't expect. I was getting new errors and not the ones I was before. It felt like growth.


**Struggles in the process:**
I think my biggest struggles was not getting stuck sitting at my computer starting at a screen in the middle of the night when I should really just walk away and take a break, lol. I wanted to push through and find the answer but every time it got me no where. When I would walk away and come back later the problem always seemed smaller or more manageable.

**What I learned:**
Breaks are important and to really acknowledge the growth I have had. As I am balancing more things it is easy to not notice your own growth and progress but when you ignore that you cant get yourself in a rut.
